1b:T192b,<h1>How Do I Know If My Real Estate Agent Is Legit?</h1><p>Buying or selling property in the UAE is one of the biggest financial decisions you will make. To ensure the process is safe, smooth, and transparent, working with a legit real estate agent is absolutely essential. Unfortunately, fake or unlicensed agents do exist, and they can cause financial loss, stress, and wasted time.</p><p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through the top ways to verify if a real estate agent is genuine and trustworthy. Plus, you’ll learn how PropertySeller’s innovative Agent Verification Tool makes it easier than ever to deal only with official, approved professionals.</p><h2>Why It’s Important to Verify Your Real Estate Agent</h2><p>A genuine real estate agent acts as your trusted advisor throughout the buying or selling journey. They handle negotiations, oversee paperwork, and make sure your interests are protected. </p><p>Our agent verification feature ensures that every representative you interact with is officially registered and approved by our team. By verifying an agent, you can be confident that you’re speaking to someone who is trained, authorized, and committed to delivering professional service.</p><p>This process protects you from unauthorized individuals and guarantees that your bookings, payments, and information are always handled securely. It’s one more way we make sure every step of your journey—starting with your first conversation—is safe, reliable, and transparent.Verifying your agent helps you:</p><ul><li><p>Avoid scams from unauthorized individuals</p></li><li><p>Ensure your payments and documents are handled securely</p></li><li><p>Gain peace of mind that you’re working with a licensed professional<br><br></p></li></ul><h2>Signs of a Legit Real Estate Agent</h2><p>Here are the best ways to tell if your real estate agent is authentic:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Check Their License and Certification<br></strong> In the UAE, every real estate professional must be licensed with RERA (Dubai) or the relevant local authority. Always ask to see their license.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seek Agents with an Online Presence</strong><br> A professional real estate agent will often have listings, social media activity, or a profile on trusted platforms like Propertyseller.</p></li><li><p><strong>Review Market Experience</strong><br> A legit real estate agent should have proven experience in buying and selling properties in your area.</p></li><li><p><strong>Check Client Reviews and Testimonials<br></strong> Positive feedback builds credibility. Fake agents usually have little to no verifiable reviews.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assess Communication and Market Knowledge<br></strong> A professional real estate agent should communicate openly, answer your questions, and provide accurate insights on current property trends.</p></li><li><p><strong>Confirm Office and Business Address<br></strong> Fake agents usually operate without a clear office presence. Visit their office or check their business registration to confirm legitimacy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Look for Red Flags in Contracts<br></strong> A legit real estate agent is always transparent in documentation. Never sign unclear or incomplete contracts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Beware of Unrealistic Promises<br></strong> If the deal sounds too good to be true, it likely is. Genuine real estate agents provide realistic expectations based on market data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Check Their Agency Affiliation</strong><br> Real estate professionals working with reputable brokerages or platforms like PropertySeller provide more security to clients.<br><br></p></li></ul><h2>PropertySeller’s Real Estate Agent Verification Tool</h2><p>To make the process easier, PropertySeller has introduced the Agent Verification Tool. With this feature, you can instantly check whether a real estate agent is officially affiliated with PropertySeller.</p><p>This assures you that the agent is:</p><ul><li><p>Registered with the platform</p></li><li><p>Screened and approved by our team</p></li><li><p>Trained to deliver transparent and professional services<br><br>With this tool, your property journey becomes safer, smarter, and more reliable from the very first interaction.</p></li></ul><h2>FAQ About Real Estate Agents</h2><h3>How do I check if a real estate agent is legit in Dubai?</h3><p>You can verify a real estate agent in Dubai by checking their RERA license number through the official Dubai Land Department website or app. Always ask for their license and cross-check before proceeding or you can check with the agent verification tool provided by PropertySeller, to see if they are affiliated with our team.</p><h3>How do I identify a fake real estate agent?</h3><p>Fake real estate agents lack proper licensing, avoid providing clear documentation, make unrealistic promises, and may pressure you into rushed deals. They often can’t provide proof of office address or credible past clients.</p><h3>Are real estate agent fees included in closing costs?</h3><p>Yes, in most transactions, the real estate agent commission is part of the overall closing costs. In Dubai, agency fees are typically around 2% of the property sale price (but it may vary depending on the developer).</p><h3>Can a real estate agent enter property without permission?</h3><p>No, a real estate agent cannot enter a property without permission from the owner or tenant. All visits must be pre-scheduled, and the client’s privacy must always be respected.</p><h3>What makes a real estate agent trustworthy?</h3><p>A trustworthy real estate agent is licensed, transparent, communicative, and knowledgeable about the local market. They maintain integrity in all dealings and ensure your rights as a client are respected at every stage.</p><p><br><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p><p>Verifying your real estate agent before making any property decisions in the UAE is essential to avoid scams and ensure peace of mind. By following the checks above and using the PropertySeller Agent Verification Tool, you can confirm that your agent is registered, reliable, and trustworthy.</p><p>Your safety comes first - don’t leave your property journey to chance.</p><p>Now at ease?

Avoid scams from unauthorized individuals



Ensure your payments and documents are handled securely



Gain peace of mind that you’re working with a licensed professional



Signs of a Legit Real Estate Agent

Here are the best ways to tell if your real estate agent is authentic:





Check Their License and Certification
 In the UAE, every real estate professional must be licensed with RERA (Dubai) or the relevant local authority. Always ask to see their license.



Seek Agents with an Online Presence
 A professional real estate agent will often have listings, social media activity, or a profile on trusted platforms like Propertyseller.



Review Market Experience
 A legit real estate agent should have proven experience in buying and selling properties in your area.



Check Client Reviews and Testimonials
 Positive feedback builds credibility. Fake agents usually have little to no verifiable reviews.



Assess Communication and Market Knowledge
 A professional real estate agent should communicate openly, answer your questions, and provide accurate insights on current property trends.



Confirm Office and Business Address
 Fake agents usually operate without a clear office presence. Visit their office or check their business registration to confirm legitimacy.



Look for Red Flags in Contracts
 A legit real estate agent is always transparent in documentation. Never sign unclear or incomplete contracts.



Beware of Unrealistic Promises
 If the deal sounds too good to be true, it likely is. Genuine real estate agents provide realistic expectations based on market data.



Check Their Agency Affiliation
 Real estate professionals working with reputable brokerages or platforms like PropertySeller provide more security to clients.
